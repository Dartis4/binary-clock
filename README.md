# binary-clock
A binary clock written in C for the Texas Instruments MSP432R microcontroller using their Code Composer Studio software. This is my final semester project for my Microprocessor Based System Design class.

See the [Project Report](https://github.com/Dartis4/binary-clock/blob/master/Final_Project.pdf) for details on the project.

See also this YouTube video I made explaining how the whole project works! [video](https://youtu.be/1WTI7uzjeys?si=s9cRs_k4Cx-Z2vCP)
